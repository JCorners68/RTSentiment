# RTSentiment Data Tier UAT Test Results

## Test Environment
- **Date:** April 30, 2025
- **Tester:** [User]
- **Environment:** Linux WSL (Ubuntu)
- **Python Version:** 3.12
- **Repository:** https://github.com/JCorners68/RTSentiment.git (branch: adv_data_tier)
- **Dremio Version:** Latest (via Docker)

## Test Summary

| Test Category | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Repository Setup | ✅ PASS | Successfully cloned the repository |
| Python Environment | ✅ PASS | Successfully created virtual environment and installed packages |
| JDBC Driver Setup | ✅ PASS | Driver JAR file located and configured |
| Dremio Container | ✅ PASS | Docker container running and accessible |
| REST API Connectivity | ✅ PASS | Successfully authenticated and retrieved catalog data |
| JDBC Connectivity | ❌ FAIL | Unable to establish JDBC connection due to JPype error |

## Error Analysis

The main issue encountered was with the JDBC connectivity through Python's JPype bridge. The specific error is:

```
RuntimeError: Can't find org.jpype.jar support library
```

This error occurs in the `_verify_jdbc_driver` method when attempting to initialize the JVM. It appears to be an issue with JPype's installation or configuration rather than with the RTSentiment codebase structure itself.

```

## Path Forward Recommendations

1. **Fix JPype Installation**:
   - Try alternative JPype versions: `pip install JPype1==1.4.0`
   - Ensure Java version compatibility (JPype may work better with Java 8)
   - Install JDK development packages: `sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk`

2. **Alternative Connectivity Options**:
   - Utilize direct REST API connectivity to Dremio for critical operations
   - Consider using alternative Java bridge libraries like py4j

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Ensure JAVA_HOME is correctly set
   - Verify CLASSPATH includes the Dremio JDBC driver
   - Check permissions on the driver JAR file

## Conclusion

The RTSentiment data tier implementation is partially working. The Dremio infrastructure is correctly running and accessible via REST API, but the direct JDBC connectivity from Python is encountering Java bridge issues that need to be resolved.

While the Python module imports and code structure are correct, the actual JDBC connectivity functionality is not currently operational due to the JPype configuration issue.

This should be considered a conditional pass with the caveat that JDBC connectivity needs further configuration in the deployment environment.
