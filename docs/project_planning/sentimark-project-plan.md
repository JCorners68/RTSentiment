# Sentimark Accelerated Development Plan: Optimizing CCA for Kickstarter Launch Success

## Executive Summary

This refined project plan delivers comprehensive strategies to accelerate technical velocity for Sentimark's upcoming Kickstarter launch by mid-summer. As Lead Technical Architect with AI expertise from a market-leading management consulting firm, you'll leverage Claude Code Assistant (CCA) effectively through strengthened prompts, robust Definition of Done (DoD) practices, optimized website structure, and systematic CI/CD debugging approaches. The plan emphasizes quality, verification, and preventing premature task completion to ensure Sentimark presents a polished, professional product to potential backers and investors.

This plan builds upon your existing assets, including a finBERT model, data plan, paid data subscriptions, and foundational infrastructure components, with a key focus on developing an advanced sentiment analysis capability based on an agentic AI system as referenced in your GitHub repository. The strategy accommodates the constraints of being a self-funded solo developer with limited daily development time (120-minute evening sessions and 5-minute "quickies"), while leveraging your preferred technology stack (React/Next.js, NestJS).

## 1. CI/CD Troubleshooting & Triage Framework

Based on the recurring issues with CI/CD pipelines, particularly with Helm, Terraform, and GitHub Actions, we've developed a comprehensive troubleshooting framework specifically designed for use with CCA. This addresses your immediate concern about tackling CICD bugs with a systematic approach and taking a closer look at the Helm CICD fix report.

### Systematic Diagnosis Approach

The key to effective CI/CD troubleshooting with CCA is a structured approach that moves from identification to resolution:

1. **Error Classification**: Categorize the error type (Helm, Terraform, GitHub Actions, etc.)
2. **Context Gathering**: Collect relevant logs, configs, and environment details
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Determine the underlying issue through systematic investigation
4. **Solution Implementation**: Apply targeted fixes with verification steps
5. **Prevention Measures**: Implement safeguards to prevent recurrence
6. **Validation**: Confirm fixes work in the actual pipeline, not just locally

### Helm Chart Troubleshooting (High Priority)

Based on the helm_cicd_fix_report, we've identified common issues and resolution strategies with particular focus on Kubernetes schema validation and securityContext placement issues:

| Issue Pattern | Diagnostic Approach | Resolution Strategy | CLI Verification Commands |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Schema validation errors (Missing required field "containers") | Run `helm lint` and `helm template` to identify specific validation failures. Look specifically for validation errors with securityContext placement | Correct YAML structure according to K8s schema. Move securityContext fields from pod-level to container-level as needed | `helm lint ./chart && helm template ./chart | kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f - && echo "Schema validation passed"` |
| Resource definition misplacements | Check for incorrectly nested fields (e.g., securityContext at pod vs. container level) | Move fields to correct hierarchical level following Kubernetes object model | `kubectl explain pod.spec.securityContext && kubectl explain pod.spec.containers.securityContext && helm template ./chart | grep -A 10 securityContext` |
| Indentation errors | Review YAML indentation, especially in templated sections | Fix indentation and use `yamllint` | `yamllint ./chart/**/*.yaml && helm template ./chart > rendered.yaml && yamllint rendered.yaml` |
| securityContext placement | Verify securityContext is defined at proper level (pod vs. container) | Move securityContext settings to appropriate level based on K8s API version | `helm template ./chart | grep -n -A 5 -B 5 securityContext && helm install --dry-run --debug ./chart | grep -n "validation"` |
| Template function errors | Look for incorrect syntax in Go template functions | Correct template syntax | `helm template --debug ./chart 2>&1 | grep "function"` |

### Terraform State Locking Issues (Medium Priority)

| Issue Pattern | Diagnostic Approach | Resolution Strategy | Verification Steps |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| ConditionalCheckFailedException | Check for abandoned locks in DynamoDB | Use `terraform force-unlock <LOCK-ID>` | Verify lock removal in DynamoDB |
| S3 backend conflicts | Examine S3 bucket for corruption or permissions | Correct permissions or backend configuration | Test with minimal `terraform plan` |
| Concurrent execution | Identify running processes that might hold locks | Implement better pipeline locks or timeouts | Review CI pipeline for parallel execution |

### GitHub Actions Failures (Medium Priority)

| Issue Pattern | Diagnostic Approach | Resolution Strategy | Verification Steps |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Missing secrets | Check secrets referenced vs. configured | Add missing secrets to repository settings | Validate with echo statements (masked) |
| YAML syntax errors | Validate workflow YAML structure | Fix syntax and use GitHub's YAML linter | Test with small commits to trigger workflow |
| Environment variable issues | Verify env var scope and references | Correct env var definitions and references | Test with explicit echo outputs |
| Runner environment problems | Check for tool version mismatches | Specify exact versions in workflow | Use setup-* actions with pinned versions |

### CCA Triage Prompt for CI/CD Issues

```
As a senior DevOps engineer and technical architect familiar with Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, and GitHub Actions, I need your help troubleshooting a CI/CD pipeline issue with Sentimark's deployment.

ERROR CONTEXT:
[Paste the full error log or message]

RELATED CONFIGURATION:
[Paste relevant YAML, Terraform, or configuration files]

ENVIRONMENT DETAILS:
- GitHub Actions runner: ubuntu-latest
- Kubernetes version: [version]
- Helm version: [version]
- Terraform version: [version]

PREVIOUS FIXES ATTEMPTED:
- [Details of any previous fix attempts or related issues that were resolved]

Please analyze this issue following these steps:

1. CLASSIFY THE ERROR: Identify the specific type of error and which tool/component is failing. Be precise about whether this is a syntax, schema, connection, permission, or other issue type.

2. PINPOINT THE CAUSE: Explain what specific part of the configuration is causing the issue. Reference specific line numbers or blocks in the provided configuration.

3. PROVIDE A FIX: Give me a specific code/configuration change to resolve the issue. Show both the original problematic code and your corrected version, explaining exactly what changed and why.

4. CLI VERIFICATION COMMANDS: Provide EXACT CLI commands I should run to verify the fix worked. Include expected output for each command. These CLI commands must:
   - Actually test the functionality, not just check syntax
   - Be runnable both locally and in CI environment
   - Include validation that the change resolves the specific error
   - Test that no new issues were introduced

5. PREVENTION: Suggest specific guardrails or validation steps to prevent this issue in the future, such as linting rules, pre-commit hooks, or CI checks.

6. SIMILAR ISSUES: Identify any other parts of the configuration that might have similar issues.

Look carefully at indentation, syntax, and field placement. In Kubernetes/Helm, pay special attention to:
- securityContext placement (pod-level vs. container-level)
- Required fields like 'containers' in pod specs
- Correct API versions and kind definitions
- Valid YAML structure, especially in multi-line strings and lists

For Terraform issues, examine:
- State locking issues (particularly for ConditionalCheckFailedException errors)
- Provider authentication and version constraints
- Resource dependencies and lifecycle blocks
- Variable scoping and interpolation

For GitHub Actions, check:
- Secret reference syntax and availability
- Step dependencies and workflow sequencing
- Environment variable propagation
- Runner compatibility issues

Remember that CI/CD errors often manifest differently than local testing due to environment differences. Provide a solution that will work reliably in the automated pipeline, not just locally.
```

### Specific Helm Fix Verification

Based on the `helm_cicd_fix_report`, let's create a focused prompt for verifying the securityContext fix which addresses the specific critical issue that was causing deployment failures:

```
As a senior Kubernetes expert and technical architect, I need your help verifying and explaining a Helm chart fix for securityContext placement issues. We previously had errors with our Deployment manifests that were supposed to be fixed but I need to verify the changes thoroughly.

The error we encountered was:
Error: error validating data: ValidationError(Deployment.spec.template.spec): missing required field "containers" in io.k8s.api.core.v1.PodSpec

According to the helm_cicd_fix_report, the fix involved moving securityContext fields from pod-level to container-level. Here's the current template after the supposed fix:

[Paste the current Helm template]

Please:
1. Validate if the securityContext fields are correctly placed according to Kubernetes schema validation requirements
2. Explain exactly why the previous placement caused the "missing required field 'containers'" error, as this seems counterintuitive
3. Check if there are any remaining issues with the container specification that could cause validation errors
4. Provide a minimal working example of correct securityContext placement for both pod-level and container-level settings
5. Give me specific CLI commands to thoroughly validate this template without deploying. Each command should:
   - Verify a specific aspect of the template correctness
   - Include expected successful output
   - Also show how to detect if the error still exists
6. Explain how to systematically check other templates for similar issues (including any automated tools we could integrate into CI)
7. Provide a validation step I can add to our CI pipeline to catch these issues before they cause deployment failures

For CLI commands, include a complete verification script that can be added to our pipeline to catch similar issues across all Helm charts. The script should be executable in both local and CI environments.

I need to understand not just if the fix works, but why it works and how to prevent similar issues across all our Helm charts.
```

### General Pipeline Debugging (Ongoing)

- Ensure each pipeline step outputs logs for errors
- If deployment fails, look at container logs in staging
- Run each stage manually (build, test, deploy) in isolation to pinpoint failures
- Keep Terraform and Helm CLI versions consistent across environments

## 5. Documentation Strategy for Knowledge Management

As part of the overall development plan, we need a structured approach to documentation that supports our rigorous verification and quality standards. This documentation strategy will help maintain knowledge and ensure that future development, even with the constraints of limited daily development time, can proceed efficiently.

### 5.1 Documentation Structure and Organization

Following the principle that primary knowledge for the project needs to be under the `/docs` folder structure, we recommend implementing this structured hierarchy:

```
project-root/
├── README.md                 # Project overview, quick start, basic info
├── docs/                     # Main documentation folder
│   ├── index.md              # Documentation home/navigation
│   ├── architecture/         # System design documents
│   │   ├── overview.md       # High-level architecture
│   │   ├── data-tier.md      # Data storage approach
│   │   └── security.md       # Security considerations
│   ├── development/          # Development guides
│   │   ├── setup.md          # Dev environment setup
│   │   ├── code-style.md     # Code standards
│   │   └── testing.md        # Testing strategy
│   ├── operations/           # Operational documentation
│   │   ├── deployment.md     # Deployment procedures
│   │   ├── monitoring.md     # Monitoring/alerting
│   │   └── troubleshooting/  # Troubleshooting guides
│   │       ├── helm.md       # Helm-specific issues
│   │       └── terraform.md  # Terraform-specific issues
│   ├── api/                  # API documentation
│   │   ├── endpoints.md      # API endpoints reference
│   │   └── models.md         # Data models/DTOs
│   └── features/             # Feature-specific documentation
│       ├── basic-sentiment.md
│       └── advanced-sentiment.md
├── component-a/
│   └── README.md             # Brief component-specific info
└── component-b/
    └── README.md             # Brief component-specific info
```

Component-level READMEs should be brief and focus on the essential information needed for working with that specific component, while referring to the main documentation in the `/docs` folder for comprehensive information.

### 5.2 Documentation Tagging System

To ensure better indexing and searchability of documentation, we'll implement a metadata tagging system using YAML front matter at the beginning of markdown documents:

```markdown
---
title: "Advanced Sentiment Analysis Architecture"
description: "Technical overview of the agentic AI architecture for advanced sentiment analysis"
tags: 
  - architecture
  - ai
  - sentiment
  - agentic
  - advanced
author: "Lead Technical Architect"
created: "2025-05-10"
last_updated: "2025-05-10"
version: "1.0"
status: "draft|review|approved"
---

# Advanced Sentiment Analysis Architecture

[Document content...]
```

This tagging system will enable:
- Better search and discovery of documentation
- Clear understanding of document status and relevance
- Tracking of documentation lifecycle
- Ability to generate documentation indexes and navigation automatically

### 5.3 CLI Verification Documentation

Consistent with our emphasis on CLI verification throughout the plan, each feature document should include a dedicated section for CLI verification commands:

```markdown
## CLI Verification Commands

The following commands can be used to verify the feature is working correctly:

### Basic Functionality
```bash
# Verify the service is running
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/health/sentiment

# Test sentiment analysis with sample text
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sentiment/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "This is a test message with positive sentiment!"}'

# Expected output:
# {"sentiment": "positive", "confidence": 0.92, "timestamp": "2025-05-10T15:30:00Z"}
```

### Error Handling
```bash
# Test with invalid input
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sentiment/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

# Expected output:
# {"error": "Missing required field: text or url must be provided", "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR"}
```
```

This approach ensures that verification steps are clearly documented and can be reproduced by anyone on the team or future developers.

### 5.4 Documentation CI/CD Integration

To maintain documentation quality, we'll integrate documentation validation into the CI/CD pipeline:

- Markdown linting to ensure consistent formatting
- Link checking to prevent broken references
- YAML front matter validation for proper metadata
- Documentation build and preview for complex documentation

This ensures that documentation remains a first-class citizen in the development process, supporting the rigorous quality standards established throughout the project plan.

### 5.5 CCA Documentation Prompt Template

To leverage Claude Code Assistant for consistent documentation generation, we'll use this documentation-focused prompt template:

```
As a senior technical writer familiar with the Sentimark project, please create comprehensive documentation for [component/feature]. This documentation will live in the /docs folder and follow our structured documentation approach.

The documentation should include:
1. YAML front matter with appropriate tags
2. Clear explanation of purpose and functionality
3. Architecture/design considerations
4. Usage examples with code samples
5. CLI verification commands with expected outputs
6. Troubleshooting section for common issues
7. References to related documentation

Use a clear, professional tone that would be appropriate for both technical team members and potential investors reviewing our project.

Make sure the CLI verification commands are comprehensive and actually test the functionality, not just syntax.

The documentation should be in Markdown format and follow our documentation structure guidelines.
```

By implementing this comprehensive documentation strategy, we ensure that knowledge is properly captured, maintained, and discoverable throughout the Sentimark development process.

## Implementation Roadmap

To effectively leverage this plan for the upcoming Kickstarter launch by mid-summer, the following implementation roadmap is recommended, taking into account your limited daily development time (120-minute evening sessions and 5-minute "quickies") and self-funded status. Each phase includes specific CCA prompts to honor the system prompt and preferences.

### Phase 1: Foundation & CICD Stabilization (Week 1)

This phase combines the critical foundation setup with immediate CICD pipeline stabilization, including secure credential management for Azure.

#### 1.1 Environment Setup & System-Level CCA Integration

```bash
# Update CLAUDE.md in project root with the system prompt wrapper
cat > CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
# Claude Code Assistant Guidelines for Sentimark

## System Prompt
You are the Sentimark Senior Technical Lead responsible for implementing a sophisticated mobile application leveraging unique "hidden alpha" sentiment analysis features for financial markets. You have extensive experience as a Lead Technical Architect at a top-tier management consulting firm, with particular expertise in AI and agentic systems.

DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES:
1. QUALITY FIRST: Implement complete, production-ready solutions - never suggest stubs, mocks (except in tests), or temporary fallbacks unless explicitly requested. Avoid declarations of completion when work is only partially implemented.

2. VERIFICATION REQUIRED: Work incrementally and provide explicit verification steps for each component (commands with exact syntax, expected outputs, screenshots of what success looks like). ALWAYS include CLI validation steps that prove the code works. CLI commands must test actual functionality, not just syntax.

3. CLI TESTING IMPERATIVE: Every implementation must include CLI commands that verify the feature works correctly. These must be executable by others and test actual functionality, not just compilation.

4. ERROR HANDLING: Implement comprehensive error handling with appropriate logging. Consider failure modes, edge cases, and unexpected inputs. Every public method must handle errors gracefully.

5. TESTING: Create automated tests (unit/integration) for all code. Ensure tests cover edge cases, failure scenarios, and performance considerations. Meet or exceed coverage targets in the project plan.

6. PERFORMANCE: Consider performance implications, particularly for database operations with our dual-database architecture (PostgreSQL/Iceberg) and agentic AI operations.

7. SECURITY: Follow security best practices for authentication, data protection, and input validation. Special attention to API endpoints and data processing.

8. DOCUMENTATION: Document all significant components, APIs, and implementation decisions. Include README updates when introducing new features.

9. CI/CD AUTOMATION: Avoid manual steps in deployment pipelines. All deployments should be fully automated and reproducible. Implement proper validation and rollback capabilities.

10. ARCHITECTURE ALIGNMENT: Ensure all implementations align with Sentimark's dual-database architecture (PostgreSQL/Iceberg) and mobile-first design principles. The agentic AI system design should follow patterns from the RTSentiment GitHub repository.

This phase establishes the data pipeline for sentiment analysis and sets up the website on Bluehost.

#### 2.1 Data Collection Service Implementation

**CCA Prompt for Data Collection Service:**

```
claude-system "I need to implement a reliable data collection service for Sentimark that collects financial news from both Yahoo Finance and RapidAPI. The service should:

1. Handle API authentication securely
2. Implement rate limiting and retries for API stability
3. Store collected data in a structured format
4. Run on a schedule via cron jobs
5. Include comprehensive logging

I'm using NestJS for the backend and have existing paid subscriptions to these data sources. Please provide:

1. The core service implementation with error handling
2. Data DTOs for consistent storage format
3. Configuration for secure credential management
4. CLI commands to verify the service is collecting data properly
5. Implementation of the scheduler

Since this is a critical foundation component, the code must be production-ready with no stubs or fallbacks."
```

#### 2.2 Jekyll Website Foundation

**CCA Prompt for Jekyll Website Setup:**

```
claude-system "I need to set up a Jekyll-based website for Sentimark that will be hosted on Bluehost. The website should:

1. Have a clean, professional design highlighting our 'hidden alpha' sentiment analysis capabilities
2. Be optimized for SEO and fast loading
3. Include sections for features, about, and Kickstarter campaign information
4. Be responsive for mobile viewing
5. Follow the color scheme: Primary #2E5BFF, Secondary #8C54FF, Accent #00D1B2, Text #333333

Please provide:
1. The core Jekyll configuration and directory structure
2. HTML/CSS for the main templates
3. Implementation of the homepage with all key sections
4. Deployment instructions specific to Bluehost
5. CLI commands to build and test the site locally

This will be the primary marketing site for the Kickstarter campaign, so it needs to effectively communicate our technical leadership and unique agentic AI approach."
```

#### 2.3 Website Content Strategy

**CCA Prompt for Website Content Generation:**

```
claude-system "I need compelling content for the Sentimark website that explains our unique 'hidden alpha' sentiment analysis approach powered by an agentic AI system. Please create:

1. A headline and subheadline for the homepage that captures our value proposition
