## Definition of Done

A task is considered complete when:

1. The implemented feature functions correctly across all supported browsers and devices
2. The code is validated, linted, and follows project conventions
3. The feature has been tested by at least one other team member
4. Any required documentation has been updated
5. The feature passes accessibility checks
6. The feature does not negatively impact performance metrics
7. The changes have been deployed to the production environment
8. Validation evidence has been documented (screenshots, test results, etc.)

## Validation Methods

For each implemented feature, the following validation methods should be used:

1. **Cross-browser testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
2. **Device testing**: Desktop, tablet, and mobile
3. **Performance testing**: Lighthouse scores (aim for 90+ on all metrics)
4. **Accessibility testing**: WAVE or axe tools, screen reader testing
5. **User testing**: Test with 2-3 users unfamiliar with the project

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Build site for production
cd ui/website
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build

# Test site locally
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

# Run Lighthouse CI
npx lighthouse-ci https://sentimark.com

# Validate HTML
npx html-validate "_site/**/*.html"

# Check for broken links
npx broken-link-checker https://sentimark.com
```

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1**: Visual & Branding, Content & Copy
