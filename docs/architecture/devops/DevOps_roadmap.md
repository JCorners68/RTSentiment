# Sentimark DevOps Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the strategic implementation plan for enhancing Sentimark's DevOps capabilities over the next 18 months. Building on the solid foundation established in the current DevOps architecture, this plan focuses on scaling, automation, and operational excellence to support the growing Sentimark platform.

## Current Architecture Assessment

The existing Sentimark DevOps architecture provides a strong foundation with:

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform implementation for Azure resources with state management in Azure Storage.
* **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes deployment via Helm charts with environment-specific configurations.
* **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflows for testing, building, and deploying.
* **Monitoring & Observability**: Initial implementation with Prometheus, Grafana, and Azure services.
* **Security Implementation**: Key Vault integration and Kubernetes Secret Store CSI driver.
* **Cost Management Focus:** Proactive measures for cost optimization, including right-sizing, automated scaling, specific subscriptions for Dev/Test, and monitoring, are well-considered.  
* **Clear Future Vision:** The "Future Growth Areas" section shows foresight and a commitment to continuous improvement.

**Areas Already Addressed from Previous Recommendations (based on earlier Helm chart discussions):**

* helm lint is part of the CI/CD pipeline (implied by "Helm Chart Security Scan" and "Helm chart validation").  
* Automated security scanning for Helm charts is in place.  
* The use of common and service-specific Helm charts suggests a move towards templating for consistency.  
* Documentation for security settings and validation is being actively developed.

### **Incremental Roadmap for Improvement**

The existing "Future Growth Areas" in devops_architecture.md are excellent starting points. This roadmap integrates those and suggests a phased approach.
