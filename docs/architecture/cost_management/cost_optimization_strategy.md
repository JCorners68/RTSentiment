# Sentimark Cost Management and Optimization Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the cost management strategy for the Sentimark platform across all environments. Effective cost management is a critical aspect of our DevOps architecture, ensuring that we maximize value while minimizing unnecessary expenditure.

## Cost Management Principles

1. **Pay for What You Need**: Right-size resources based on actual workload requirements
2. **Elasticity First**: Scale resources up and down based on demand
3. **Environment-Appropriate Spending**: Apply different cost optimization strategies for different environments
4. **Continuous Optimization**: Regularly review and optimize resource allocation
5. **Cost Visibility**: Maintain transparency for all costs across the platform

## Cost Optimization by Environment

### Development Environment

| Strategy | Implementation | Estimated Savings |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Ephemeral Resources | Automatic shutdown of dev environments after hours | 60-70% |
| Developer Sandbox Limits | Resource quotas for developer environments | 30-40% |
| Shared Resources | Common test databases and services | 50% |
| Low-tier Services | Use basic tier for supporting services | 70% |

### SIT Environment

| Strategy | Implementation | Estimated Savings |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Scheduled Scaling | Scale down during off-hours | 40-50% |
| Right-sized Resources | Optimized resource requests and limits | 20-30% |
| Spot Instances | Use spot VMs for fault-tolerant workloads | 60-80% |
| Storage Optimization | Lifecycle policies for test data | 40% |

### UAT Environment

| Strategy | Implementation | Estimated Savings |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| On-demand Provisioning | Environment created only when needed | 70% |
| Test Data Management | Efficient test data generation and cleanup | 30% |
| Scaled-down HA | Reduced replicas while maintaining architecture | 50% |
| Service Tier Optimization | Mid-tier services instead of premium | 30% |

### Production Environment

| Strategy | Implementation | Estimated Savings |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Reserved Instances | 1-year and 3-year reserved instances for steady workloads | 40-60% |
| Autoscaling | KEDA-based scaling for microservices | 20-30% |
| Storage Tiering | Lifecycle policies for hot/cool/archive data | 40-50% |
| Resource Governance | Strict resource quotas and limits | 15-20% |

## Azure Cost Management Implementation

### Resource Tagging Strategy

All resources must be tagged with:

| Tag Name | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Environment | Deployment environment | production, development, sit, uat |
| CostCenter | Financial allocation | engineering, data-science, operations |
| Application | Application or component name | api-service, data-processor |
| Owner | Team or individual responsible | data-team, platform-team |
| Expiration | For temporary resources | 2025-12-31 |

### Budget Alerts

| Environment | Monthly Budget | Alert Thresholds | Notification Recipients |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Development | $2,000 | 70%, 90%, 100% | dev-team@sentimark.com |
| SIT | $5,000 | 70%, 90%, 100% | qa-team@sentimark.com, devops@sentimark.com |
| UAT | $8,000 | 70%, 90%, 100% | product-team@sentimark.com, devops@sentimark.com |
| Production | $25,000 | 80%, 90%, 100%, 110% | finance@sentimark.com, operations@sentimark.com |

### Cost Reports

## Terraform Cost Optimization Module

The `infrastructure/terraform/azure/modules/cost-management` module implements:

1. **Budget Definitions**: Azure Budgets with notification settings
2. **Advisor Recommendations**: Automated implementation of cost recommendations
3. **Auto-shutdown Schedules**: VM and AKS auto-shutdown for dev/test environments
4. **Lifecycle Policies**: Storage account data lifecycle management
5. **Cost Anomaly Detection**: Alerts for unusual spending patterns

## Kubernetes Cost Optimization

### Resource Management

1. **Request and Limits**: Properly defined for all containers
   ```yaml
   resources:
     requests:
       cpu: 100m
       memory: 128Mi
     limits:
       cpu: 500m
       memory: 512Mi
   ```

2. **Namespace Quotas**: Enforced for all environments
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ResourceQuota
   metadata:
     name: compute-resources
   spec:
     hard:
       requests.cpu: "10"
       requests.memory: 20Gi
       limits.cpu: "20"
       limits.memory: 40Gi
   ```

3. **Pod Disruption Budgets**: For service availability during scaling
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: policy/v1
   kind: PodDisruptionBudget
   metadata:
     name: api-pdb
   spec:
     minAvailable: 2
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: api-service
   ```

### Autoscaling Configuration

1. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**: Scale based on CPU/memory
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
   kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
   metadata:
     name: sentiment-processor
   spec:
     scaleTargetRef:
       apiVersion: apps/v1
       kind: Deployment
       name: sentiment-processor
     minReplicas: 2
     maxReplicas: 10
     metrics:
     - type: Resource
       resource:
         name: cpu
         target:
           type: Utilization
           averageUtilization: 70
   ```

2. **Cluster Autoscaler**: Dynamically scale node pools
   ```terraform
   resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster_node_pool" "user_pool" {
     # other configuration...
     enable_auto_scaling = true
     min_count           = 1
     max_count           = 5
   }
   ```

3. **KEDA Scaling**: Event-driven autoscaling for specific workloads
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
   kind: ScaledObject
   metadata:
     name: eventhub-scaler
   spec:
     scaleTargetRef:
       name: event-processor
     minReplicaCount: 0
     maxReplicaCount: 20
     triggers:
     - type: azure-eventhub
       metadata:
         connectionFromEnv: EventHubConnectionString
         consumerGroup: event-processor
         unprocessedEventThreshold: '10'
   ```

## Spot Instance Strategy

### Workload Classification

| Workload Type | Spot Eligibility | Examples |
|---------------|------------------|----------|
| Stateless Services | High | API services, event processors |
| Batch Processing | High | Data analysis, reporting jobs |
| Dev/Test Systems | High | Development environments |
| Stateful Services | Low | Databases, state stores |
| Mission-Critical | None | Core transaction services |

### Implementation

1. **Node Selectors**: For spot-tolerant workloads
   ```yaml
   nodeSelector:
     agentpool: spotnodepool
   ```

2. **Pod Tolerations**: For graceful eviction handling
   ```yaml
   tolerations:
   - key: "kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority"
     operator: "Equal"
     value: "spot"
     effect: "NoSchedule"
   ```

3. **Disruption Handling**: Graceful shutdown for spot instances
   ```yaml
   terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60
   ```

## Storage Optimization

### Storage Tiering Strategy

| Data Type | Access Pattern | Recommended Tier |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Hot Operational Data | Frequent access | Premium SSD / Hot Blob |
| Warm Reference Data | Occasional access | Standard SSD / Cool Blob |
| Cold Archival Data | Rare access | Archive Blob Storage |
| Transient Processing | Temporary | Ephemeral Disk |

### Lifecycle Policies

Automatic data movement between tiers:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "moveToArchive",
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
          "prefixMatch": ["sentiment-data/"]
        },
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": {"daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30},
            "tierToArchive": {"daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 90}
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Monitoring and Reporting
