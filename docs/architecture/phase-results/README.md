## Purpose

These documents provide detailed reports on the outcomes, achievements, and lessons learned from each implementation phase. They serve as both historical records and references for understanding how the system evolved through its development lifecycle.

## Project Phases

1. **Phase 1: Foundation Setup** - Core domain entities, repository interfaces, feature flag system
2. **Phase 2: Interface Abstraction** - Exception handling, transaction management, specification pattern
3. **Phase 3: Iceberg Implementation** - Iceberg schema design, repository factory, partitioning strategies
4. **Phase 4: Testing and Verification** - Data integration testing, performance benchmarking, error handling
5. **Phase 5: Production Deployment** - Full production implementation with Iceberg
