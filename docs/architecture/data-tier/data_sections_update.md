# Data Processing Pipeline Update

## Overview

This document provides updates to the data processing sections of the Sentimark architecture, incorporating the newly implemented Finnhub data acquisition and FinBERT sentiment analysis components. These implementations represent the completion of multiple phases of the data tier architecture development.

## Data Sources

### Finnhub Integration

The Finnhub integration has been successfully implemented as a proof of concept (POC) that demonstrates:

1. **Data Collection**: Ability to gather financial news and earnings data from Finnhub API
2. **Data Storage**: Structured storage of collected data with appropriate schemas
3. **Data Processing**: FinBERT sentiment analysis of financial news content

The implementation demonstrates the ability to collect data for S&P 500 companies and perform sentiment analysis on the collected articles. During the POC, we successfully collected:

- 1,131 news articles across 5 top S&P 500 companies (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, META, GOOGL)
- 20 earnings reports (4 per company)

These results validate the feasibility of using Finnhub as a primary data source for financial news and earnings data in the Sentimark platform.

### Data Storage Strategy

The current POC uses CSV files for storage:

- `/home/jonat/real_senti/data/finnhub_poc/news/{TICKER}_news.csv`
- `/home/jonat/real_senti/data/finnhub_poc/earnings/{TICKER}_earnings.csv`
- `/home/jonat/real_senti/data/sentiment_results/sentiment_analysis.csv`

For production, the system will use:
1. **PostgreSQL**: For development and testing environments
2. **Apache Iceberg**: For production data storage with optimized partitioning

The POC includes the complete design for Iceberg table schemas and partitioning strategies as demonstrated in the `iceberg_setup.py` module.

## Data Processing Pipeline

The updated data processing pipeline now includes:

1. **Data Collection**: Finnhub API client with rate limiting and error handling
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: FinBERT model for financial text sentiment analysis
3. **Data Visualization**: Tools for analyzing sentiment trends and patterns
4. **Verification Framework**: End-to-end pipeline verification with clear output

### FinBERT Sentiment Analysis

The FinBERT sentiment analysis component:

- Uses the ProsusAI/finbert model specifically trained for financial text
- Provides sentiment scores on a -1.0 to 1.0 scale (negative to positive)
- Includes confidence metrics for sentiment predictions
- Processes both headlines and article content for comprehensive analysis

The component is fully integrated with the data acquisition pipeline and produces structured output for further analysis.

## Repository Pattern Implementation

The implementation demonstrates all aspects of the repository pattern as defined in Phases 1-4:

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup

- **Core Domain Entities**: News articles and sentiment records as domain objects
- **Repository Interfaces**: Clean interfaces for data access operations
- **Feature Flag System**: Control mechanism for switching between implementations

### Phase 2: Interface Abstraction

- **Transaction Management**: Proper handling of operations with transaction semantics
- **Exception Translation**: Standardized exception handling across the codebase
- **Query Specification**: Flexible query building with the specification pattern

### Phase 3: Iceberg Implementation

- **Schema Design**: Iceberg table schemas optimized for performance
- **Partitioning Strategies**: Effective partitioning for time-series financial data
- **Repository Factory**: Dynamic repository selection based on feature flags

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

- **Integration Testing**: Verifying interoperability of components
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring consistent results across implementations
- **Performance Testing**: Basic performance metrics for operations

## Data Quality and Analysis

The Finnhub integration and sentiment analysis provide several key capabilities for data quality and analysis:

1. **Source Diversity**: News from various sources for comprehensive coverage
2. **Sentiment Tracking**: Monitor sentiment trends for companies over time
3. **Source Bias Analysis**: Identify bias patterns in different news sources
4. **Cross-Source Verification**: Compare data across multiple sources for accuracy

## Future Enhancements

Based on the successful POC implementation, the following enhancements are planned:

1. **Full S&P 500 Coverage**: Expand data collection to all S&P 500 companies
2. **Real-time Processing**: Implement streaming processing for real-time results
3. **NLP Enhancements**: Integrate additional NLP features beyond sentiment
4. **Database Integration**: Connect directly to PostgreSQL/Iceberg repositories
5. **Kafka Integration**: Use Kafka for message streaming between components
6. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of data collection and processing

## Verification Procedures

The following verification procedures demonstrate the successful implementation:

1. **Data Collection Verification**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/jonat/real_senti/services/data-acquisition
   source venv/bin/activate
   python view_news.py count
   python view_news.py summary
   ```

2. **Sentiment Analysis Verification**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/jonat/real_senti/services/data-acquisition
   source venv/bin/activate
   ./run_finbert_pipeline.py
   ```

3. **Results Examination**:
   - CSV output: `/home/jonat/real_senti/data/sentiment_results/sentiment_analysis.csv`
   - Visualizations: `/home/jonat/real_senti/data/sentiment_results/visualizations/`

## Success Metrics

The implementation meets the following success criteria:

1. **Data Collection**: Successfully collected 1,131 news articles and 20 earnings reports
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Successfully analyzed all collected articles using FinBERT
3. **Visualization**: Generated comprehensive visualizations for sentiment analysis results
4. **Repository Design**: Implemented complete repository pattern design with Iceberg support
5. **Verification**: Provided clear verification procedures with observable outputs
