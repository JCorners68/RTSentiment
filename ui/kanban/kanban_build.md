  - Error handling strategies documentation in `ui\kanban\docs\error_handling.md`
    1. API Errors
       - Implement exponential backoff for Claude API calls
       - Store intermediate results to avoid repeating successful steps
       - Provide clear error messages that indicate where the process failed
    2. Parsing Failures
       - Implement multi-stage fallback parsing
       - When all else fails, return raw response for manual handling
    3. Git Operation Failures
       - Check for Git conflicts before operations
       - Provide detailed error context (branch status, conflict files)
    4. Idempotency
       - Use correlation IDs to track operations
       - Check for existing branches/PRs before creating new ones
- [ ] Create user guides
  - Basic usage guide in `ui\kanban\docs\user_guide.md`
  - Advanced features guide in `ui\kanban\docs\advanced_guide.md`
  - Troubleshooting guide in `ui\kanban\docs\troubleshooting.md`
  
#### 5.2 API Documentation (2 days)
- [ ] Create OpenAPI specification
  - Define complete API schema in `ui\kanban\docs\api\openapi.yaml`
  - Include all endpoints, parameters, and responses
- [ ] Generate interactive API documentation
  - Setup Swagger UI for API exploration
  - Create documentation generation script
  - Implement in `ui\kanban\scripts\generate_api_docs.js`

## Asynchronous Processing Model

The architecture uses an asynchronous processing model:

1. CLI Kanban companion server exposes a local API (localhost:3000)
2. Each CLI command sends a webhook to n8n and returns immediately
3. n8n processes asynchronously and calls back to the local API
4. The CLI Kanban UI refreshes to show updated state

### Phase 6: Integration and Final Testing (4 days)

#### 6.1 Integration Testing (2 days)
- [ ] Create end-to-end test scenarios
  - Test complete workflows from epic creation to completion
  - Test evidence management across all operations
  - Implement in `ui\kanban\tests\integration`
- [ ] Test n8n integration
  - Verify webhook functionality
  - Test Claude API integration
  - Create test suite in `ui\kanban\tests\n8n_integration`

#### 6.2 User Acceptance Testing (1 day)
- [ ] Create UAT script
  - Document test scenarios in `ui\kanban\docs\uat.md`
  - Include success criteria for each feature
- [ ] Conduct UAT session
  - Record feedback and issues
  - Prioritize fixes based on feedback

#### 6.3 Final Deployment Preparation (1 day)
- [ ] Create deployment documentation
  - Step-by-step installation instructions in `ui\kanban\docs\installation.md`
  - Configuration guides for different environments
- [ ] Create demo dataset
  - Sample epics, tasks, and evidence in `ui\kanban\data\demo`
  - Import script at `ui\kanban\scripts\load_demo_data.py`
- Use absolute paths for all files referenced or created
- Never store files in project root directory
- Implement consistent directory structure
- Use configuration files for path management
- Handle file permissions appropriately
