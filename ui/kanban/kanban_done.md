### Phase 1 Summary 

Phase 1 successfully established the core architecture and framework for the Kanban CLI application with special emphasis on the Evidence Management System as a priority feature. All planned components were implemented and thoroughly tested.

A comprehensive summary report is available at [Phase 1 Summary](docs/phase1_summary.md).

Based on Phase 1 implementation, we've identified several key insights to improve Phase 2 development:

1. **Clearer Task Definition**: Some Phase 1 tasks lacked precise acceptance criteria. Phase 2 tasks include more explicit definitions of "done" with verification steps.

2. **Increased Focus on Priority Features**: The Evidence Management System is our highest priority. Phase 2 accelerates this development by allocating more resources and addressing it first.

3. **Test-Driven Approach**: Phase 1 demonstrated the value of comprehensive testing. Phase 2 adopts a stronger test-driven development approach with tests created before implementation.

4. **Documentation Integration**: Documentation will be written alongside code rather than after completion to ensure accuracy and completeness.

5. **Cross-Platform Considerations**: Phase 2 includes explicit cross-platform testing to ensure compatibility across operating systems.

6. **Performance Benchmarking**: Phase 1 lacked performance metrics. Phase 2 includes benchmarks to validate performance with large datasets.
