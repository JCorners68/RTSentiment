## Phase 2 Summary

Phase 2 focuses exclusively on enhancing the Evidence Management System, which is the highest priority feature. The implementation follows a comprehensive approach, addressing data modeling, storage, CLI commands, UI improvements, API integration, and thorough testing.

Upon completion, the Evidence Management System will provide:

- Robust schema with hierarchical categorization and relationship modeling
- Comprehensive attachment handling with security and integrity features
- Advanced search capabilities with multiple filtering options
- Rich terminal-based visualization for evidence relationships
- Integration with existing task and epic systems
- High performance even with large datasets
- API endpoints for external tool integration

The phase prioritizes the Evidence Management System above all other features, ensuring it receives the most attention and resources. All development follows the lessons learned from Phase 1, with clearer acceptance criteria, stronger test-driven development, and integrated documentation.

**Phase 2 Summary:**
- [ ] Create a summary report at `ui\kanban\docs\phase2_summary.md`
- [ ] Summarize phase 2.  this will serve as context for future development  It should be around 150 lines.  
- [ ] It should include links to all documentation.
- [ ] move Phase 2  to ui\kanban\kanban_done.md and remove the detail from here.
- [ ] update phase 3 with any lessons learned.  What can we do better?
- [ ] Critically evaluate the work completed in the  phase 2. Do these tests and evidence indicate a production ready phase?
