The reframed content consistently communicates:
1. A strong foundation built by the founder
2. Plans for strategic team expansion following funding

By implementing these changes, the website now presents an honest yet compelling narrative about a solo founder building an innovative company with plans for future growth, rather than pretending to have a team that doesn't exist.
