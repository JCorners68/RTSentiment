## Technical Guidance

### Visual Style Guide
- Use a consistent color palette based on Sentimark brand colors:
  - Primary Blue: #2E5BFF
  - Secondary Purple: #8C54FF
  - Accent Teal: #00D1B2
  - Dark Background: #1E1E2D
  - Light Background: #F8F9FA

### Animation Guidelines
- Data visualizations should flow smoothly with elegant transitions
- Interface demonstrations should be realistic but idealized (perfect user flow)
- Use subtle particle effects for the "hidden alpha" concept
- Incorporate gradual builds in complexity for technical explanations

### Audio Direction
- Professional male or female voiceover with authoritative but approachable tone
- Background music should be:
  - Modern, tech-forward composition
  - Building gradually in intensity
  - Free of vocals or distracting elements
  - Subtle bass line suggesting confidence and innovation

### Camera and Motion
- Clean, stable shots for interface demonstrations
- Dynamic but controlled movement for conceptual sequences
- Professional interview framing for team/testimonial segments
- Subtle depth-of-field effects to focus attention

### Typography
- Use Inter font family for all text overlays (matching the Sentimark website)
- Minimum text size for readability on mobile devices
- Important statistics and numbers should be animated for emphasis

### Editing Rhythm
- Begin with slower, more deliberate pacing
- Increase tempo slightly through the problem/solution sequence
- Return to confident, measured pacing for the closing sequence
- Total runtime: 2:30 - 2:45 (optimal for Kickstarter engagement)
