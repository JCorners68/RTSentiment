# Kickstarter Page Enhancements

## Countdown Timer Implementation

The Kickstarter page features a countdown timer that displays the time remaining until the campaign launch on July 4, 2025. The implementation is designed to be robust and work across different browsers and environments.

### Key Files

1. **HTML Structure**: `/pages/kickstarter/index.html`
   - Contains the countdown timer HTML elements
   - Includes an inline fallback script for immediate rendering
   - Uses proper CSS and JS references

2. **JavaScript Logic**: `/assets/js/countdown.js`
   - Handles the dynamic countdown functionality
   - Uses multiple initialization methods for reliability
   - Includes comprehensive error handling
   - Animates the countdown digits
   - Updates UI elements when countdown ends

3. **CSS Styling**: `/assets/css/countdown.css`
   - Custom styling for the countdown timer
   - Animations for digit changes
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Gradient backgrounds and visual enhancements

4. **Testing**: `/test_countdown.html` and `/test_countdown.sh`
   - Test page for isolated timer verification
   - Test script to verify all components are in place

### Implementation Details

The countdown timer uses a dual-approach strategy for maximum reliability:

1. **External JavaScript File**:
   - Initializes as early as possible
   - Retries initialization if DOM elements aren't available yet
   - Updates the timer every second
   - Handles error cases gracefully

2. **Inline Fallback Script**:
   - Provides immediate values without waiting for external JS
   - Detects if external script has already updated the values
   - Only runs if needed

### Verification

To verify the countdown is working correctly:

1. Run the test script: `./test_countdown.sh`
2. Start the Jekyll server: `./serve_quiet.sh`
3. Visit http://localhost:4000/kickstarter/
4. Check browser console for any errors

### Future Maintenance

If you need to change the launch date:
1. Update the date in both `countdown.js` and the inline script in `index.html`
2. The date format used is: "July 4, 2025 09:00:00"

## Other Enhancements

1. **Jekyll Warnings Suppression**:
   - Added `quiet_deps: true` to `_config.yml`
   - Created `serve_quiet.sh` script that filters SASS deprecation warnings

2. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Enhanced highlight cards with animations
   - Improved button styling and interactions
   - Added gradient backgrounds to key elements

3. **Image Links**:
   - Fixed all dead image links in the template
   - Used consistent path references with Jekyll's `relative_url` filter

4. **Video Content**:
   - Added proper video embedding for the campaign video
   - Used correct path references that work both locally and in production
