# RT Sentiment Analysis - Testing Strategy

## Testing Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the RT Sentiment Analysis system, including test types, organization, and execution procedures.

## Test Organization

All services follow a consistent testing structure:

```
tests/
├── unit/               # Unit tests for individual components
├── integration/        # Integration tests between components
├── e2e/                # End-to-end tests
└── performance/        # Performance and load tests
```

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components in isolation.

- **Scope**: Individual functions, classes, and modules
- **Tools**: pytest
- **Location**: `services/<service-name>/tests/unit/`
- **Naming Convention**: `test_<component_name>.py`
- **Coverage Target**: >85% code coverage

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the interactions between different components within a service.

- **Scope**: Interactions between components
- **Tools**: pytest
- **Location**: `services/<service-name>/tests/integration/`
- **Naming Convention**: `test_<component1>_<component2>.py`
- **Coverage Target**: >70% integration path coverage

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests verify complete workflows across multiple services.

- **Scope**: Full system workflows
- **Tools**: pytest, Selenium (for UI)
- **Location**: `services/<service-name>/tests/e2e/`
- **Naming Convention**: `test_<workflow_name>.py`
- **Coverage Target**: All critical user workflows

### Performance Tests

Performance tests evaluate system performance under load.

- **Scope**: System performance and scalability
- **Tools**: locust, pytest
- **Location**: `services/<service-name>/tests/performance/`
- **Naming Convention**: `test_<component>_performance.py`
- **Coverage Target**: All critical performance paths

## Environment-Specific Tests

### SIT Environment Tests

- **Location**: `environments/sit/tests/`
- **Purpose**: Verify SIT environment setup and functionality
- **Execution**: Automated after environment setup

### UAT Environment Tests

- **Location**: `environments/uat/tests/`
- **Purpose**: Verify UAT environment setup and functionality
- **Execution**: Automated after environment deployment

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Sources

- **Synthetic Data**: Generated within tests
- **Anonymized Data**: Derived from production but anonymized
- **Mock Data**: Predefined test fixtures

### Data Isolation

Test data is isolated from production data and stored separately.

## Test Execution

### Local Execution

Run tests locally using:

```bash
# Run unit tests
cd services/<service-name>
pytest tests/unit

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration

# Run e2e tests
pytest tests/e2e

# Run performance tests
pytest tests/performance

# Run all tests
pytest tests/
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Execution

Tests are automatically executed in the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Unit tests run on every commit
2. Integration tests run on every pull request
3. E2E tests run before deployment
4. Performance tests run nightly

## Test Monitoring and Reporting

Test results are reported using:

- JUnit XML for test results
- Coverage reports for code coverage
- Performance trend reports

## Continuous Improvement

The testing strategy is continuously improved based on:

- Defect analysis
- Coverage metrics
- Performance test results
- Feedback from production issues

## Responsibilities

- **Developers**: Unit tests and integration tests
- **QA Engineers**: E2E tests and performance tests
- **DevOps Engineers**: Environment-specific tests
