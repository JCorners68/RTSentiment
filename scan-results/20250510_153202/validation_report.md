| Values Validation | ✅ PASSED | Checked values against schema |
| Template Rendering | ✅ PASSED | Rendered and verified templates |
| SecurityContext | ✅ PASSED | Verified proper placement of security settings |
| Security Checks | ✅ PASSED | Scanned for security best practices |

## Detailed Findings

### Errors

- Values file is not valid YAML/JSON
- Found 2 container-specific securityContext settings at pod level
- These should be moved to container level. See /home/jonat/real_senti/scan-results/20250510_153202/security_context_issues.txt for details.

### Warnings

- Required command not found: yq
- Required command not found: yamllint
- Required command not found: kubesec
- Schema documentation is below 80% coverage. Consider adding more descriptions.
- Required command not found: yq
- yq not found, falling back to manual validation
- Cannot perform full schema validation without yq
- Required command not found: yamllint
- yamllint not found, skipping YAML syntax validation
- Not all containers have resource limits. Found 0/28.
- Required command not found: kubesec
- kubesec not found, skipping detailed security scan

## Recommendations

1. Fix all errors before deploying to any environment
2. Ensure all container-specific securityContext properties are at container level, not pod level
3. Set appropriate resource limits and requests for all containers
4. Update schema to cover all chart values with proper validation
5. Integrate this validation script into your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early
