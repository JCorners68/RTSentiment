# Financial Sentiment Data Acquisition Report

## Executive Summary

This report evaluates potential data sources to expand our financial sentiment analysis system. Our current system processes approximately 5,000 news articles and 20,000 Reddit posts per year, which provides a solid foundation but insufficient coverage for comprehensive market analysis. This report identifies additional data sources, evaluates their quality, pricing, and integration feasibility, and presents recommendations for expanding our sentiment data pipeline.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Data Sources
- **News Scrapers**: ~300 articles/month (10 articles/day)
- **Reddit Scrapers**: ~1,200 posts/month (40 posts/day)
- **Total Volume**: ~1,500 items/month

### Sentiment Analysis Implementation
- **Primary Model**: FinBERT (specialized financial sentiment analysis model)
- **Secondary Models**:
  - FinGPT (for premium users)
  - Llama4-Scout (for professional tier users)
- **Processing Pipeline**:
  1. Data collection via scrapers
  2. Deduplication (11% dedup rate for news, 63% for Reddit)
  3. Sentiment scoring via appropriate model based on source, premium tier, and content length
  4. Storage in Parquet format organized by ticker

### Limitations of Current System
1. **Volume Limitations**: Current coverage is inadequate for comprehensive market analysis
2. **Source Diversity**: Limited to free, publicly accessible content
3. **Historical Data**: Limited backfilling capabilities
4. **Real-time Coverage**: Delays in news processing reduce trading value

## Integration Requirements

To successfully integrate additional data sources, we need to:

1. **Data Format Compatibility**: Ensure new sources can be processed by our existing pipeline
2. **Deduplication Enhancements**: Improve hash-based deduplication to handle increased volume
3. **Model Suitability**: Ensure FinBERT can handle specialized content from new sources
4. **Storage Scaling**: Expand Parquet storage capabilities for larger volumes
5. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limiting for commercial APIs

## Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we recommend a three-tier approach to expanding our data acquisition:

### Tier 1: Immediate Implementation (1-2 months)
1. **Alpha Vantage News API** ($150/month - Premium plan)
   - 50,000 API calls/day
   - Financial news from 50+ global sources
   - Simple JSON API integration
   - Minimal custom development required

2. **GDELT Project** ($0-$200/month for compute resources)
   - Free global news database with sentiment scoring
   - 15-minute update frequency
   - Integration requires cloud infrastructure for processing

### Tier 2: Medium-term Integration (3-6 months)
1. **StockTwits API** ($850/month - Developer package)
   - Specialized financial social media content
   - 30x more market-focused social content than our current Reddit scraping
   - Requires custom sentiment model tuning for platform-specific language

2. **Nasdaq Data Link** ($500/month - Base package)
   - Multiple financial datasets
   - Pre-analyzed sentiment for major indices and stocks
   - Premium financial news sources

## Return on Investment

Implementing the recommended data acquisition strategy would:

1. **Increase Data Volume**: From ~1,500 to ~100,000 items/month (67x increase)
2. **Improve Data Quality**: Add professional financial sources with higher accuracy
3. **Enhance Coverage**: From ~265 tickers to ~2,000+ tickers with meaningful data
4. **Enable Real-time Analysis**: Reduce processing latency from hours to minutes
5. **Support Premium Features**: Enable tiered service offerings for premium customers

## Conclusion

Expanding our data acquisition capabilities is essential for improving our financial sentiment analysis system. By implementing the recommended three-tier approach, we can significantly increase both the quantity and quality of data processed by our system, enabling more accurate and comprehensive sentiment analysis for financial markets. The phased implementation plan allows for incremental improvements while managing costs and technical complexity.

We recommend starting with the Phase 1 implementation to quickly achieve a 10x increase in data volume, followed by the additional phases as the system proves its value with the expanded dataset.
