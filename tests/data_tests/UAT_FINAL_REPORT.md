| Table Creation | ✅ PASS | Successfully created tables with Iceberg format |
| Data Write Operations | ✅ PASS | Successfully wrote test data records |
| Data Read Operations | ✅ PASS | Successfully read and verified test data |

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Dremio JDBC SQL Dialect Compatibility

**Issue**: Dremio's SQL dialect incompatibility with standard `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` queries.

**Resolution**: Modified the `_ensure_table_exists()` method in `DremioJdbcWriter` class to use Dremio-compatible syntax for checking table existence. Instead of standard `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` queries, implemented a more compatible approach using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` pattern and error handling to check for existing tables.

### 2. Java/Python Integration

**Issue**: JVM initialization errors and library path issues with JPype.

**Resolution**: Updated the JVM arguments in the environment setup script to include necessary `--add-opens` parameters required for Java 11+ compatibility. Added proper CLASSPATH configuration and symbolic links to ensure the Dremio JDBC driver is correctly located.

### 3. Module Import Path Issues

**Issue**: Python module import errors when running verification scripts.

**Resolution**: Created a wrapper script that correctly sets PYTHONPATH and environment variables before executing verification scripts, ensuring consistent module resolution regardless of the current working directory.

## Recommendations for Production Deployment

1. **REST API First Approach**: Given the challenges with JDBC/Java integration, prioritize the REST API approach for production deployments where possible, using JDBC only for specific high-performance requirements.

2. **Connection Pooling**: Implement proper connection pooling for production environments to reduce connection overhead and improve fault tolerance.

3. **Automated Environment Setup**: Develop a comprehensive automation script for setting up the entire environment, including prerequisites checking, component configuration, and connectivity verification.

4. **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate Dremio testing into CI/CD pipelines for automated validation of schema changes and performance testing of queries.

5. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring for the Dremio system, including connection metrics, query performance, and resource utilization.

## Conclusion

The UAT for the RTSentiment data tier has been successfully completed with all identified issues resolved. The system is now ready for production deployment with the recommended enhancements.

The implementation provides a robust solution for storing and analyzing sentiment data using modern data lake technologies, offering both high performance and scalability for future growth.
