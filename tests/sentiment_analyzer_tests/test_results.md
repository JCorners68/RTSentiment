# Ticker Sentiment Analyzer Test Results

## Test Environment
- Date: April 24, 2025
- Python Version: 3.12.3
- OS: Linux (WSL)

## Unit Test Results

### Linear Decay Function Test
- Status: ✅ PASSED
- Notes: Fixed implementation to match test expectations. Linear decay now returns 0.0 at half-life.

```
test_default_decay (tests.sentiment_tests.test_decay_functions.TestDecayFunctions.test_default_decay)
Test default decay behavior. ... ok
test_exponential_decay (tests.sentiment_tests.test_decay_functions.TestDecayFunctions.test_exponential_decay)
Test exponential decay function. ... ok
test_half_life_decay (tests.sentiment_tests.test_decay_functions.TestDecayFunctions.test_half_life_decay)
Test half-life decay function. ... ok
test_linear_decay (tests.sentiment_tests.test_decay_functions.TestDecayFunctions.test_linear_decay)
Test linear decay function. ... ok

### Redis Cache Tests
- Status: ⚠️ SKIPPED
- Notes: Tests require the `redis` package to be installed.

### Impact Scoring Tests
- Status: ✅ PASSED (Based on initial test run)
- Notes: All tests passed in the initial run before running into dependency issues.

### Sentiment Model Tests
- Status: ⚠️ SKIPPED
- Notes: Tests require the `numpy` package to be installed.

### Legacy Sentiment Analyzer Tests
- Status: ⚠️ SKIPPED
- Notes: Tests are for a legacy implementation that doesn't match the current architecture. These need to be updated or deprecated.

## Integration Test Status

No formal integration tests have been created yet. Recommended next steps:

1. Create integration tests that verify:
   - Parquet data loading to Redis
   - Sentiment calculation with time decay
   - Full data flow from Parquet to UI

## Performance Test Status

No formal performance tests have been conducted. Recommended next steps:

1. Create performance benchmarks for:
   - Loading large volumes of historical data (100K+ events)
   - Calculating sentiment for 50+ tickers
   - Redis read/write performance under load

## Test Coverage

The current test suite covers the following components:

| Component | Test Coverage | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Decay Functions | All functions | ✅ Complete |
| Impact Scoring | Source weights, engagement | ✅ Complete |
| Redis Cache | Event serialization, storage | ⚠️ Dependency Issues |
| Sentiment Model | Score calculation | ⚠️ Dependency Issues |
| Parquet Reader | File reading, filtering | ❌ Not Tested |
| S&P 500 Tracker | Ticker listing, updates | ❌ Not Tested |
| Main Service | Component initialization | ❌ Not Tested |
| UI | Dashboard rendering | ❌ Not Tested |

## Manual Testing Notes

The system has been manually verified for:

- Proper initialization of components
- Basic decay function logic
- Impact scoring calculations

## Known Issues

1. Dependency management:
   - Need to ensure all required packages are installed before running tests

2. Legacy tests:
   - test_sentiment_analyzer.py needs updating to match current architecture

3. Missing test coverage:
   - Several components have no automated tests yet

## Recommendations

1. Install required dependencies for comprehensive testing
2. Update or remove legacy test files
3. Add tests for untested components
4. Create integration and performance tests
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
